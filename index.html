      <h1>Personal Information</h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is Andrew. I’m 27 years old, from Melbourne. I currently work full-time as a mechanic in the hire industry whilst studying online with RMIT.
        I am passionate about travelling, I have lived overseas in the UK for a couple of years where I made some incredible memories. Unfortunately, the
        pandemic cut my travels short, and I had to come home. My favourite pastimes are friends and family, sports like football and hockey and
        playing video games as a way to relax and unwind.  <p/>

      <h1>Interest In IT</h1>
      <p>My first interest in IT first came from gaming consoles. As a young kid who spent most of their childhood outdoors, I was instantly
        captivated when my Dad pulled out his old Sega Genesis. I remember the first thing he did was blow out the cartridge in order to make it work.
        I loved playing video games like Alex the Kidd, Sonic and Street fighter. Thankfully, as a grew up, I was introduced into more advanced consoles
        like GameCube and Xbox which led to my fascination about building my own computer. I think this really sparked my interest even more understand
        the possibilities of being able to build and customise your own technologies. Fast forward to today and although I have dabbled in writing
        some code, designing apps I want further develop these skills to be able to start a career in IT.</p>
      <p>I knew I wanted to pursue a career in IT at some point and I definitely knew I want to be a full stack designer. Someone who is always hands on,
        involved in all aspects of a project, can design, and build a website from start to finish. Through a lot of research, I felt RMIT offered the
        most well-rounded, complete course to experiment with all aspects of front-end & back-end development.</p>
      <p>I expect to learn a lot through this course, experience new things, be challenged with every task, activity, or assignment, improve my social,
        communication and teamwork skills and be prepared to gain knowledge about an industry I hope to work in.</p>

      <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
      <h2> <a href="https://app.otta.com/jobs/c0NObTdC" target='_blank'</a>EA Games - Full Stack Developer</a></h2>

      <p>EA Games is a major game development company that creates some of most renowned AAA tiles in the market. The position of a full stack developer entails working on both the front end and back end of large-scale creative web development projects. This could be from implementing modern features into existing projects, managing data systems and collaborate with many different branches across the EA network such as engineering and other development teams. </p>

      <h3>Required Skills</h3>
        <p>As a full stack developer, the skillset of being able to effectively work and connect anywhere in a project means you need to be able to communicate in many different systems. This could be programming languages like JavaScript, CSS, or HTML. Front or back-end frameworks like React, Bootstrap or Java and even experience with database technology like SQL.</p>


      <h3>My Current Skills</h3>
        <p>My current experience with these programs is minimal. I do have more experience using the Adobe suite like Illustrator, InDesign, and XD. Prior to studying with RMIT I undertook a short 4-week course where I learnt some basics in coding using Visual Studio Code and CSS to style webpages we built.</p>


      <h3>Development Plan</h3>
        <p>I hope that by the end of this course I will have experience in the main systems I will require to enter an entry level developer / programming job. I would even like to explore applying for graduate programs in the final years of studying to try to gain some experience and understanding in the industry. Furthermore, exploring different systems and programs outside of studying will be key to building a strong foundation. I know I won’t be able to master all of these requirements straight away, but I want to be proficient in the essentials like Java, HTML and CSS.</p>

        <h1>Profile</h1>

        <h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
        <p>Virtuoso, 76% Introverted, 52% Observant, 54% Thinking, 58% Prospecting, 64% Turbulent.</p>

        <h3>Learning Styles Test</h3>
        <p>25.8% Reflector, 34.4% Theorist, 34.4% Pragmatist, 5.5% Activist.</p>

        <h3>Big Five Personality Test</h3>
        <p>22% Extroversion, 11% Emotional stability, 35% Agreeableness, 15% Conscientiousness, 34% Intellect / Imagination.</p>

        <p>Overall, I believe the result from these tests are fairly accurate to how I would describe my personality. I feel that I align more with the Myers-Briggs and Learning Styles tests as they describe being introverted, logical thinking and hands on as the highest attributes. </p>
        <p>I think it may influence my behaviour in a positive way. Knowing that I am that introverted person that struggles with voicing my opinions or ideas could help to not settle into that stereotype but instead contribute towards the group. </p>
        <p>It is probably best to look for individuals on the opposite end of the spectrum to the results I have as it can help to form a diverse group full of different types of personalities. Looking for an individual that is extroverted and an activist could help to push myself to contribute more towards the group.</p>

        <h1>Project Ideas</h1>

          <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The aim of the project will be to develop a smartphone application for the care, treatment and tracking of indoor house plants. Through this app, users will be able to see their collection of plants in list or grid format, see how they should care for their plants, what their plants require, diseases that may affect their plants and how to treat them. Furthermore, users will be able to add a way of tracking water, feeding, and repotting periods and set gentle reminders.</p>

          <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>The motivation behind this application is personal. During the pandemic, my wife and I found collecting indoor plants as a new hobby as well as a way to decorate our flat. It was however difficult to find good advice on how to care for these specific plants as the small tag provided with the plant was vague and doesn’t outline proper care instructions. This resulted in searching the internet and Facebook groups to seek help on common care requirements, information about diseases and treatments. As there were a large number of social media groups that discussed this topic, I could see the potential for an application that stores all this information in one location to help users care for their plants.</p>

          <h3>Description</h3>
            <p><span>Personalized accounts</span> In order to use the app, users must create an account with a username and password. This account will generate their profile where they will be able to store their plant listing against their account, share with others and log into other devices where their database will already be loaded.</p>
            <p><span>Plant Database</span> Users will be able to search through a database of various indoor plants. From here they will be able to add the plants they have to their ‘owned’ section OR favourite the plants they aspire to eventually purchase. Selecting a plant in this screen will also give the user an overview of the general requirements for owning that plant. For example, light level and positioning, humidity, growth size, etc.  </p>
            <p><span>Storing Owned Plants</span> An area in the application where users will be able to see the plants, they currently own. This again will give a general overview of the plants requirements as well as common issues, plant diseases, and treatments. </p>
            <p><span>Tracking</span> An option to track the last time a specific plant was watered, given fertiliser or feed and even track when it’s due to be repotted or given fresh soil.</p>
            <p><span>Common Issues, Pests, and Diseases</span> A main feature of the app will be a page dedicated to listing common issues, pests, and diseases among plant varieties along with treatments and advise. This will include images of the pest or disease on various types of plants, what to look for, and the treatments.</p>
            <p><span>AI Identifier</span> This feature would allow users to open the in the app camera, scan a plant they have and reveal suggestions of what type of plant it is based on a database. It could also feature a quick glimpse at what the requirements are for that plant in doors of light positioning, humidity level, growth size and difficulty. This is an incredibly advanced feature to implement into an app and the time constraint may not allow for this to be added right away.</p>

          <h3>Tools & technologies</h3>
            <p>In order for users to be able to create an account, there may be a server or SQL database linked with the application, so users’ information is able to be stored. This might be usernames, passwords and even save the selections they make on their profiles. A database may also need to be used to store relevant information about the various types of plants and diseases. Platforms from the adobe suit like photoshop, illustrator and XD may be required to build mock-ups of landing pages, or edit images. Finally, both VScode and Atom can be used to write the code for the smartphone application.</p>

          <h3>Skills Required</h3>
            <p>I think that most of the coding skills required for this program could be accessible online. Although this will be challenging as a novice to coding, there are many websites online with databases dedicated to breaking down specific parts of HTML and CSS coding. A server and/or database will be another crucial element to the application. In order to store users’ data or information about various types of plants, these may need to be implemented. These are many open-source database, management software available online such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. </p>

          <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>The successful development of this application will result in a good quality database that give users accurate information about caring for their house plants. This database will solve the issue of users having to research various platforms in order to find the answers they are looking for. This will mean less time wasted for users when researching as well as avoid confusion on differing and conflicting answers. As a result, the impact of this smartphone application will help users better understand how to care for their house plants.</p>
